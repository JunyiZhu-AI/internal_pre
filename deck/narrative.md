# Deck narrative

One section per page; one numbered beat per **click**. Speak the beat, then click —
the motion that follows illustrates what you just said (or click first and speak
over the motion; each step is short enough for either). "Load" is what's on screen
before any click.

Controls reminder: click / Space / → / PageDown = next step; last step's click goes
to the next page. ← / PageUp = previous page. Bottom-right: page arrows, restart,
loop (auto-plays all steps, for rehearsal or hallway mode). F = fullscreen.

## Page 01 — QKᵀ: where attention scores come from

**Load:** title only; empty score grid awaits.

1. **[operands arrive]** "We have four tokens — *The robot lifts boxes*. Each one
   carries a query vector, stacked into Q, and a key vector — here already
   transposed into Kᵀ, keys as columns. d_k is 3, so we can watch every single
   number."

2. **[first cell, slow]** "One score, in slow motion: the query row for *The*
   slides against the key column for *The*. Multiply the aligned entries —
   0.3·1.2, 0.1·(−0.4), 0.2·0.1 — sum them: 0.34. That's all a similarity score
   is: one dot product."

3. **[second cell]** "Next cell, same move — different column. Row times column,
   every time."

4. **[cascade]** "And the other fourteen are identical and independent — which is
   exactly why this is one dense matrix multiplication, and why hardware eats it
   for breakfast. Sixteen scores: every query against every key, in one GEMM."

5. **[÷√d]** "Before softmax, everything shrinks by √d_k. Dot products of random
   d-dimensional vectors grow in variance with d; unscaled, the logits saturate
   softmax into near one-hot and the gradients die. At d_k = 3 it's a nudge — at
   64 it's survival."

6. **[softmax rows]** "Softmax, row by row: scores become weights, each row now
   sums to one. The grid you just watched being multiplied *is* the attention
   pattern — *robot* attends to itself and to *boxes*; *The* spreads out almost
   uniformly, as function words do."
